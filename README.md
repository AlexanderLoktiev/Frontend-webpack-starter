# Frontend starter kit 2.0

This starter kit was created for easier starts of projects. <br>
It has to shrink spending time for creating project.

For work with it you have to have stable "nodejs" version.

I would recommended "nodejs" 10.13 version.
For manipulations with "nodejs" versions you can use Node Version Manager (mnv).

<p>Modify the application as you wish.</p>
<p>Make the production of your code.</p>

## Commands
```
npm start
```
<p> This includes linting as well as image, script, stylesheet and HTML optimization.
 Also, a dev server script will be automatically generated, which will take care of precaching your sites resources.</p>
 
 ```
 npm build

 <p>Creates the production folder in the root of the project with minifying files from assets. 
 It will help you to create clear instances of code for the production or further implementation.</p>
