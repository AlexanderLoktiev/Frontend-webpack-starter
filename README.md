# Frontend starter kit 2.0

This starter kit was created for easier starts of projects. <br>
It has to shrink spending time for creating project.

For work with it you have to have stable "nodejs" version.

I would recommended "nodejs" 10.13 version.
For manipulations with "nodejs" versions you can use Node Version Manager (mnv).

## Commands
```
npm start

 Also, a dev server script will be automatically generated, which will take care of precaching your sites resources.</p>
